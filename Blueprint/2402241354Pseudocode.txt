# create a database record (a dtype class object)
#   each record is a semester. each semester is an array!
#   each semester record contains:
#                           1- column courseName, dtype string
#                           2- column grade, dtype float
#                           3- column courseCredit, dtype int

# ask the user to input the semester name and store the string somewhere
# in a loop, ask the student to enter
#                            1- courseName: (store it)
#                            2- grade: (store it)
#                            3- courseCredit: (store it)
# then ask if the info is correct and student wants to
#                             1- Save and add another course to the semester
#                                   - pass semester name to array name and the course info as a row input values of the array
#                             2- Save and add another semester
#                                   - pass semester name to array name and the course info as a row input values of the array

#                             4- Exit the whole thing
# use while (true)s to keep the program up and running
